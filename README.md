# Heat Transfer algorithm

The documents presented here were developed to demonstrate the heat transfer on a 2D-structural Finn applying the finite domain analysis CVFEM (Control Volume Finite Element Method). 

Inside the folder "codigos" we can find 8 different codes, as follows:
## 1. Monta_A
Calculate the coefficients $C_{ij}$ generated by the discretization of the Integral-Differential Equation represeting the Heat Transfer (more details in the section 2.4 of the document Trabalho_1_TRANSCAL). The main purpose of this function is to convert the differential equation to its equivalent discrete form below:
```math
$$ \int_{Vc}\nabla{\cdot (K\nabla{T})}dV = [A] [T] $$
```
Where $[A]$ represents a 3-dimensional Matrix and $[T]$ represent 3-dimensional vector containing $x,y$ and $z$ components.

### Usage

```MATLAB
function [A] = Monta_A(k,P,T)

```
Inputs:
- $k$ is the heat transfer coefficient.
- $P$ represents the number of nodes inside the mesh.
- $T$ represents the temperature of each node.

Outputs:
- $A_{ij}$ coefficients of the equivalent 3D heat transfer matrix.
 
## 2. area_contorno
Calculate the areas related to each node in the contour and returns its respective normal vector.

### Usage

```MATLAB
function [Aglobal,Xbci,Ybci] = area_contorno(P,E,T,n_contorno)

```

Inputs:
- $P$ represents the number of nodes inside the mesh.
- $E$ is the heat transfer coefficient.
- $T$ represents the temperature of each node.
- $n_contorno$ represents the node in the contour.


Outputs:
- $Aglobal$  is the global coefficient of the equivalent 3D heat transfer matrix (all points).
- $Xbci,Ybci$ are the center node equivalent coordinates.

## 3. cod_principal
It is the main function of this module, responsible to assemble each code descripted in this document. Its outputs are a set of images containing the results of the mesh generation, heat transfer rate and errors.
Some of the results are:

## 4. gradiente 
This functions calculates the temperature gradients as finite differences between each element inside the mesh.

## 5. malha_grossa
This codes generates the CVFEM coarse mesh.

## 6. malha_refinada_manual_1 
This codes generates the CVFEM coarse mesh with higher quality.

## 7. malha_refinada_manual_2 
This codes generates the CVFEM fine mesh.
